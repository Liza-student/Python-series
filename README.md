#Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
#functionality:
This is a basic arithmetic calculator written in Python. It performs four operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Input Collection:
a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))
The program prompts the user to enter two numbers.

input() reads the input as a string.

int() converts that string to an integer.

So now, a and b are integers that the user entered.

Display Heading:
print("Result:")
This is just a label to show that the following lines are the results of the calculations.

Addition:
print("Addition: ", a + b)
Adds a and b, then prints the result.

Subtraction:
print("Subtraction: ", a - b)
Subtracts b from a, then prints the result.

Multiplication:
print("multiplication: ", a * b)
Multiplies a and b, then prints the result.

Division:
print("division: ", a / b)
Divides a by b, then prints the result as a floating-point number.
